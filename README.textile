h1. Transition.js

Detangled in-browser web application testing.

h1. "Documentation":http://kyleburton.github.com/transition.js

h1. Example

Check out the source code:

    $ cd ~/projects
    $ git clone https://github.com/kyleburton/transition.js.git
    $ cd transition.js
    $ git checkout -t origin/transition.js-2.0

Run the sample application:

    $ rake todo

Browse to: "http://localhost:9292/transition/index.html":http://localhost:9292/transition/index.html

h1. Getting Started

Check out the source code:

    $ cd ~/projects
    $ git clone https://github.com/kyleburton/transition.js.git
    $ cd transition.js
    $ git checkout -t origin/transition.js-2.0

In your project's document root (where ever it serves up html files from), create a symlink to the @transition.js/public@ directory

   $ cd ~/projects/my-webapp/public
   $ ln -s ~/projects/transition.js/public ./transition

Then you should be able to load @/transition/index.html@ from your web application.

For example, if your app is running on localhost:9292, then the following should be the link:

   http://localhost:4567/transition/index.html
